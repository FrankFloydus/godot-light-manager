# Godot Light Manager

### **Careful**: in super rough alpha state. Do not use!

A simple yet useful 3D light manager. It detects lights (_only OmniLight3D for now_)
in the current edited scene and open a docked panel with a list of them.
From the list it's possible to perform different operations:

- Toggle the light on/off
- Select the light in the scene
- Copy and paste settings between lights
- Change the light's color
- Change the light's energy
- Change the light's range
- Change the light's specular value
- Change the light's volumetric energy contribution
